- fix F function keychron:
What I would try and do is change the fnmode variable on your system from the boolean 1 to 0. You should be able to do this by piping an echo 0 command to tee on the file itself:

echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode
If that doesn't work, remember to set it back to 1 for consistency's sake:

echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode
